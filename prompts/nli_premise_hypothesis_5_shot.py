PROMPT = """Analyze pairs of statements about historical U.S. Supreme Court
cases to determine if they are consistent with each other. Each pair consists
of a 'premise' and a 'hypothesis' related to the core legal questions or
factual background of a specific case. Your task is to read both statements
carefully and assess whether the hypothesis accurately reflects the premise,
indicating if they are consistent or not. Provide a brief explanation before
reaching a conclusion. Present your final answer in the following format: "So,
the answer is [yes/no]."

Premise: Here are the core legal questions in Bacon et Al., Public Service
Commission of the State of Vermont, v. Rutland Railroad Company, 232 U.S. 134
(1913) in two sentences: The Supreme Court considered whether a state public
service commission had the power to fix the rates charged by a railroad company
for transporting passengers and freight, and if so, whether the commission's
rate-setting powers were limited to those rates that were reasonable and just.

Hypothesis: Here are two sentences summarizing the core legal question in Bacon
et Al., Public Service Commission of the State of Vermont, v. Rutland Railroad
Company, 232 U.S. 134 (1913): The Supreme Court considered whether a state
public service commission had the authority to regulate the rates charged by a
railroad company for transporting passengers and freight, and whether the
commission's rate-setting powers were limited to those rates that were just and
reasonable.

Q: Is the premise consistent with the hypothesis?

A: Both statements claim that the core legal question concerns the authority of
a state public service commission to regulate railroad rates. So, the answer is
yes.

Premise: Here are the core legal questions in Indianapolis and Vincennes
Railroad Company v. Backus, 154 U.S. 438 (1893) in two sentences: The case
centered on whether a state law that granted a railroad company the right of
eminent domain to acquire land for a new railroad line was preempted by federal
law, specifically the Railroad Act of 1871, which granted the federal government
the power to regulate interstate commerce.

Hypothesis: Here is the core legal question in Indianapolis and Vincennes
Railroad Company v. Backus, 154 U.S. 438 (1893) in two sentences: The issue in
the case was whether a railroad company could be held liable for damages caused
by a train accident that occurred on a public road and over which the company
had no control, but had agreed to use in exchange for a franchise to operate
its trains on the road.

Q: Is the premise consistent with the hypothesis?

A: The first statement claims that the core legal question concerns the right
of eminent domain, while the second statement claims that the core legal
question concerns the liability of a railroad for damages; these are two
different legal questions. These two statements are not consistent. So, the
answer is no.

Premise: Sure! Here's the subsequent appellate history of County of Wilson v.
National Bank, 103 U.S. 770 (1880) in two sentences: The case was appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court, which affirmed the lower court's decision in a 5-4
ruling. The Supreme Court held that the National Bank's notes were not subject
to state taxation, as they were issued by the federal government and were
therefore exempt from state taxation.

Hypothesis: The subsequent appellate history in County of Wilson v. National
Bank, 103 U.S. 770 (1880) included the Supreme Court denying a writ of
certiorari to review the decision of the court of appeals, which had affirmed
the trial court's ruling in favor of the county. The Supreme Court's decision
effectively ended the appellate proceedings and upheld the trial court's
judgment in favor of the county.

Q: Is the premise consistent with the hypothesis?

A: The premise states that the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's
decision in a 5-4 ruling, and the core legal issue was related to the state
taxation of National Bank's notes. The hypothesis, however, talks about the
Supreme Court denying a writ of certiorari, reviewing the decision of the court
of appeals, and upholding the trial court's judgment. These are different
events and do not align with the information in the premise. So, the answer is
no.

Premise: In The United States, Appellants, v. John Rodman, Assignee of Robert
M'hardy, Appellee, 40 U.S. 130 (1841), the Supreme Court held that the federal
government has the power to retroactively remove tax exemptions that were
previously granted to a state, and that the state has no legal claim to those
exemptions. The Court established that the federal government has the authority
to alter or repeal any law that it has enacted, including those that grant tax
exemptions to states.

Hypothesis: Sure! Here are the primary legal holdings of the case The United
States, Appellants, v. John Rodman, Assignee of Robert M'hardy, Appellee, 40
U.S. 130 (1841) in two sentences: The Supreme Court held that the Assignee of a
bankrupt's estate does not have the power to sue in his own name, but only as a
representative of the bankrupt.

Q: Is the premise consistent with the hypothesis?

A: The premise states that the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal
government has authority over certain tax exemptions. The hypothesis, however,
claims that the Supreme Court held that the Assignee of a bankrupt's estate
does not have the power to sue in his own name. These are two different legal
holdings. So, the answer is no.

###

Premise: Sure! Here is the primary legal holding in Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio
Railroad Co., 372 U.S. 108 (1962) in two sentences: The Supreme Court held that
a railroad worker's injury claim for damages against a third party was not
subject to the Federal Employers' Liability Act's (FELA) exclusive remedy
provision, as the injury was not caused by the railroad's negligence.

Hypothesis:  Sure! Here are the primary legal holdings of Gallick v. Baltimore
& Ohio Railroad Co., 372 U.S. 108 (1962) in two sentences: The Supreme Court
held that a railroad employee's claim for damages for injuries sustained on the
job was not barred by the Federal Employers' Liability Act's (FELA) provisions
limiting damages for "personal injury" to those that were caused by the railroad
company's negligence.

Q: Is the premise consistent with the hypothesis?

A: The premise describes a worker's claims against a third party, and states
that the Court ruled that they would not be barred by FELA's exclusive remedy
provision. The hypothesis, however, describes a worker's claims against the
railroad company, and states that the Court ruled that they would not be barred
by FELA's provisions limiting damages for "personal injury". These are two
different legal holdings. So, the answer is no.
